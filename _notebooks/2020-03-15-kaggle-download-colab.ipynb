As a result it is ideal for machine learning education and basic research.

    "There are several ways to download data from Kaggle. An easy way is to use the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). To set up the Kaggle API on Google Colab we need to run several steps. First of all we need a Kaggle API token. If you already have one, you can simply use it. However, if you do not have one or you want to create a new one, you need to do the following:\n",
    "1. You need to log into Kaggle and go to **My Account**. Then scroll down to the **API** section and click on **Expire API Token** to remove previous tokens.\n",
    "2. Then click on **Create New API Token**. It will download a `kaggle.json` file on your local machine."

    "The data should be there now. However, it happened to me that it was actually not immediately there after the unzipping finished. Apparently, Google Drive sometimes needs some time until the files are available. So, we do not need to do anything. We just need to wait. To check if all the files are there we should go to Google Drive from time to time and look into the folder. When I tried it, the `sample_submission.csv` file was always the last file. So, when this file was there, I knew all the files were there. It is important to check this directly in Google Drive and not in the folder view in Google Colab, because Google Colab seems to show the files although Google Drive does not have them yet."
