    "Currently, I mainly use Ubuntu and MacOS. Furthermore, I also get in contact with Windows from time to time. To transfer data between machines running these different operating systems I use a USB flash drive. Unfortunately, many USB flash drives don't work under Linux, Windows and MacOS at the same time out of the box. For instance, a while ago I experienced that my USB flash drive works normally under Linux and Windows, but under MacOS I only had read access but no write access. This behavior is caused by the fact that many USB flash drives are formatted  using the [NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS) file system."

You can read more about them [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/235596/whats-the-difference-between-fat32-exfat-and-ntfs/). I was looking for a file system that works under Linux, Windows and MacOS. The [exFat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT) file system meets this requirement. In the following I want to describe how I formatted my USB flash drive as exFat on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. To do so I actually followed a great [tutorial](https://appuals.com/how-to-format-a-drive-as-exfat-on-linux/) written by Kevin Arrows. In the following I will summarize it in my own words.
