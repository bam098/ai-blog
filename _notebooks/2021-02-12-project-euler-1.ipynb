Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."

However, this rule does not apply to the problems 1 to 100 as long as you do not only post the solution but also the way how you got to solution (i.e., your code or calculations).

There is nothing quite like that \"Aha!\" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself. However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere."

    "A naive approach to solve this problem is to use brute-force. We simply loop through all numbers between 3 and 999  and check which numbers are divisible by 3 or 5. The lower bound is 3 here, because we already know that 1 and 2 are not divisible by either 3 or 5. The upper bound is 999, because the problem descriptions says that we should consider numbers below 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a number is divisible by 3 or 5, we can use the [modulo operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) (in Python it's the `%` sign). The modulo operator gives you the rest of a division operation. For instance, if we want to calculate `5 / 2`, we get `2.5`. However, if we want to receive the result in whole numbers, we get `2` with a rest of `1` (`2 * 2 = 4` and `4 + rest 1` is `5`). The modulo operator gives you the rest (here `1`). We can use this to test if a number is divisible by another number, since in this case the rest must be `0`.  So, to check if a number is divisible by 3, we can use the expression `number % 3 == 0` (similarly we can check if a number is divisible by 5 using the expression `number % 5 == 0`). \n",
