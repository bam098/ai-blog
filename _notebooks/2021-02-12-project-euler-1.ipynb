    "A naive approach to solve this problem is to use brute-force. We simply loop through all numbers between 3 and 999  and check which numbers are divisible by 3 or 5. The lower bound is 3 here, because we already know that 1 and 2 are not divisible by either 3 or 5. The upper bound is 999, because the problem descriptions says that we should consider numbers below 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a number is divisible by 3 or 5, we can use the [modulo operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) (in Python it's the `%` sign). The modulo operator gives you the rest of a division operation. For instance, if we want to calculate `5 / 2`, we get `2.5`. However, if we want to receive the result in whole numbers, we get `2` with a rest of `1` (`2 * 2 = 4` and `4 + rest 1` is `5`). The modulo operator gives you the rest (here `1`). We can use this to test if a number is divisible by another number, since in this case the rest must be `0`.  So, to check if a number is divisible by 3, we can use the expression `number % 3 == 0` (similarly we can check if a number is divisible by 5 using the expression `number % 5 == 0`). \n",
