    "I have an [iPhone SE](http://tiny.cc/83denz) that I also use to take pictures. These pictures should also be accessible on my laptop running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, since I want to store them on a portable hard drive disk or I want to use them on my laptop for specific experiments. Unfortunately, accessing photos from an iPhone on Ubuntu does not work out of the box. However, I found this great [tutorial](https://www.maketecheasier.com/easily-mount-your-iphone-as-an-external-drive-in-ubuntu/) written by Ben Stockton that describes how you still can access iPhone photos on Ubuntu. In the following I will explain each step and the experience I made. If you rather want to follow the original tutorial, you can find it [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/easily-mount-your-iphone-as-an-external-drive-in-ubuntu/)."
